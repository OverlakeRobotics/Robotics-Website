        <h2> About Us </h2>
        <br>
        &emsp;We are FTC Team 7330, Nocturnal Robotics. For more information on our robot, see <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QXjsgxvcKEG2ZR3gu_SqdLgg9zf2Acjnf81LmrlrMjE/edit?usp=sharing">our team notebook.</a> We meet Mondays-Thursdays in our school makerspace, and we pride ourselves on our open-attendance policy. We recognize that most of our members have activities outside of robotics that they want to focus on, and by allowing attendance to be flexible we can include as many people as possible. Our core team is around 12 members, but we have 9 more rotating in and out as their schedules permit. We strongly believe that a diversity of thought leads to a stronger robot and the more people we include the better.
        <br><br>
        &emsp;Another key tenet of our team is our emphasis on being well-rounded both as software and mechanical engineers. We try to encourage our members to try as much as possible, because, in the end of the day, robotics is all about the learning process.

                    They think I know anything about robotics, but I just fake it till we make it. This year, I was in charge of TeleOp, implementing revolutionary, understandable, TrIbOoLEAN code, and oversaw component code. I also wrote resources to help newbies join & am currently mentoring off-season.

                    The ladies call me handsome, but you can call me Slater. This year, I was in charge of the autonomous routine, and coordinating our team's volunteer efforts as Director of Outreach. While I am a proud member of Mensa and DHS's prestigious No Fly List, I am a man who enjoys his simple, refined tastes in Minecraft, Half Life, anime, outdoorsmanship, and Playboi Carti.
