        <h2> About Us </h2>
        <br>
        &emsp;We are FTC team 7330, Overlake FTC. For more information on our robot, see <a href = "https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=969CCCE3D66ACF40%21123&authkey=%21AD7Q2-JrmCYFg3g&page=View&wd=target%28Outside%20Cover.one%7C41f0ee36-1aa7-48cc-a0ae-8b8a8bf06ae8%2FOverlake%20FTC%207330%7C9ff1209d-9aff-451b-a19c-9cb2ace3ce8e%2F%29">our team notebook.</a> We meet Mondays-Thursdays in our school cafeteria, and we pride ourselves on our open-attendance policy. We recognize that most of our members have activities outside of robotics that they want to focus on, and by allowing attendance to be flexible we can include as many people as possible. Our core team is around 10 members, but we have 15 more rotating in and out as their schedules permit. We strongly believe that a diversity of thought leads to a stronger robot and the more people we include the better.
        <br><br>
        &emsp;Another key tenet of our team is our emphasis on being well-rounded both as software and mechanical engineers. We try to encourage our members to try as much as possible, because, in the end of the day, robotics is all about the learning process.

                    My name is Evan Coulson and I am a senior. I helped build several important aspects of the robot such as autonomous opmodes, arm systems, and drive systems. On top of this I have helped develop external tools such as a configuration app and an external application that allows telemetry to log to a web server and displayed to a computer through WiFi direct.

                    Steven Abbott (13 April 2001 – present) is an American mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Abbott was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Abbott machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.

So far this year I have written my bio, worked on this website (I am writing this page right now), and written some strafing code and documentation for the mecannum drive system. A fun fact about me is that I have anosmia, which is like being blind but for smell.

I came in expecting a very informative experience, but the Overlake team gave me that and much more, with the team's fun sense of humor and great attitude. This year has been very fun so far, and I'm sure that this fun will continue on through the next years.
