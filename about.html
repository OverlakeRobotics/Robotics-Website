    <h2> About Us </h2>
    <br>
    &emsp;We meet Mondays-Thursdays in our school cafeteria, and we pride ourselves on our open-attendance policy. We recognize that most of our members have activities outside of robotics that they want to focus on, and by allowing attendance to be flexible we can include as many people as possible. Our core team is around 10 members, but we have 15 more rotating in and out as their schedules permit. We strongly believe that a diversity of thought leads to a stronger robot and the more people we include the better.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;Another key tenet of our team is our emphasis on being well-rounded both as software and mechanical engineers. We try to encourage our members to try as much as possible, because, in the end of the day, robotics is all about the learning.
